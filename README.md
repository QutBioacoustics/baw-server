Workers that can process various long-running or intensive tasks.

Includes Actions and File Storage functionality. Actions are used by workers:
Actions provide the ability to enqueue jobs to `Resque`, which are then de-queued by `Resque` workers and processed.
Actions may also be run as standalone rake tasks.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'baw-workers', git: 'https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/baw-workers.git'

or clone the repository to the current directory:

    git clone https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/baw-workers.git

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Actions


This project provides four actions. Actions are classes that implement a potentially long-running process.
A `Job` is an instance of an `Action`.

Actions can get input from the settings file when run standalone, or from Resque jobs when running as a Resque worker.

A resque worker can be set to process any queue by changing `queues_to_process` in the settings file. 
The jobs in a queue specify the action that will be used to process that job.
A standard Resque worker can be started using:

    bundle exec rake baw:worker:run['path_to_settings_file']

### Analysis

Runs analysers over audio files. This action analyses an entire single audio file.

**Option 1**: Resque jobs can be queued from [baw-server](https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/baw-server).

**Option 2**: A directory can be analysed manually by setting the `analyser_id` and `to_do_path` for the analysis action in the settings file.

Files can then be processed standalone:

    bundle exec rake baw:action:analysis:standalone:from_files['path_to_settings_file']

or queued using Resque and processed later by a standard Resque worker:

    bundle exec rake baw:action:analysis:resque:from_files['path_to_settings_file'] 

### Audio Check

Runs checks on original audio recording files. This action checks an entire single audio file.

**Option 1**: Gets audio files to check from a csv file in a specific format by specifying the setting `to_do_csv_path`.

The files can be processed standalone:

    bundle exec rake baw:action:audio_check:standalone:from_csv['path_to_settings_file']

or queued using Resque and processed later by a standard Resque worker:

    bundle exec rake baw:action:audio_check:resque:from_csv['path_to_settings_file']

### Harvest

Harvests audio files to be accessible by [baw-server](https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/baw-server) 
via the file storage system.

**Option 1**: Audio files can be harvested by specifying the setting `to_do_path`.
The `progressive_upload_directory` is treated specially: files in that directory do not require a config file as long as
their file names are in a recognised format (which includes `utc offset` and `uploader id`).

Audio files can be processed standalone:

    bundle exec rake baw:action:harvest:standalone:from_files['path_to_settings_file'] 

or queued using Resque and processed later by a standard Resque worker:

    bundle exec rake baw:action:harvest:resque:from_files['path_to_settings_file'] 

### Media

Cuts audio files and generates spectrograms.

**Option 1**: Resque jobs can be queued on demand from [baw-server](https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/baw-server)
and processed later by a Resque worker.

## File Storage

There are classes for working with file storage paths:

 - original audio files
 - caches for 
    - cut audio
    - generated spectrograms
    - analysis results.
