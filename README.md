## Dependencies

This project's dev environment is managed by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
Please ensure the latest version of Docker Desktop is installed on your machine

Audio processing and other long-running tasks are performed using [baw-workers](./baw-workers).

## Contributing

See the [git-flow.md](./git-flow.md) document for guidelines on making changes.

## Environment Setup

Clone this repo, then change directory to your cloned directory and on your **host** machine run

	$ docker-compose up

This will prepare a complete development environment. To see what is involved in
the setup, look at the  [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) and [`bin/setup`](bin/setup) files.

You can `stop` the running containers using <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd> which is equivalent
to `docker-compose stop`.

- `docker-compose stop` will stop the containers
- `docker-compose down` will stop containers, remove containers, and delete networks
    - images will not be deleted
    - the primary application state (on the postgres volume) will not be removed

**NOTE:** changes in the Dockerfile will not be reflected in docker-compose images
or containers unless the compose project is destroyed or the containers are
rebuilt.

### Destroy or rebuild the docker environment

By default docker volume state is persisted between restarts of `docker-compose`.
This means you can return to your previous development session easily. If,
however, you want to start from scratch you can remove state by doing one of
the following.

To start from scratch by **removing all containers, images, and volumes**:

    $ docker-compose down --remove-orphans --volumes --rmi local

To rebuild the `web` service / `baw-server` image (e.g. to update dependencies)
but keep state from our volume:

    $ docker-compose build

## Development

Start by running, on your **host** machine:

    $ docker-compose up

Common tasks that you may need:

- `docker-compose exec web bundle install`
- `docker-compose run web bundle exec rails console`
- `docker-compose exec web bundle exec rake db:create`
- `docker-compose exec web bundle exec rake db:migrate`
- `docker-compose stop` will stop the containers
- `docker-compose stop web` stop web container so you can do something else
- `docker-compose exec bundle exec passenger stop`
- `docker-compose exec bundle exec passenger start` - the default action for `docker-compose up`
- `docker-compose run web bash` - like `up` but starts the web service without
    running the default `passenger start` command

Use `exec` to run a command while the `web` service is running, and `run` to
start the `web` service and then run the command

When running the server in `development` or `test` modes, these configuration
files will be used:

 - `/config/settings/development.yml`
 - `/config/settings/test.yml`

They are based on `/config/settings/default.yml`.

### Tests
The tests are run using Guard, either:

    $ bin/guard

or in case the listening does not work, force the use of file polling:

    $ bin/guard guard --force-polling

Press enter to execute all tests. Guard will monitor for changes and the relevant tests will be run as files are modified.

Tests can also be run with a specified seed using rspec:

    $ rspec --seed <number>

### Style

Use this style guide as a reference: https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated from tests using [rspec_api_documentation](https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation):

    $ bin/rake docs:generate GENERATE_DOC=true

## Other commands
These commands should be executed automatically but are listed because they are helpful to know.


- Create the test database: `bin/rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test`
- Then migrate and seed the test database: `bin/rake db:migrate db:seed RAILS_ENV=test`
- Prepare the local development database:`bin/rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=development`
- Run rspec tests: `bin/rspec`
- Generate API documentation: `bin/rake docs:generate GENERATE_DOC=true`


## Production setup and deploying

Create production settings file `config/settings/production.yml` based on `config/settings/default.yml`.
Create staging settings file `config/settings/staging.yml` based on `config/settings/default.yml`.

We deploy using Ansible (and in particular [Ansistrano](http://ansistrano.com/)).
Our Ansible playbooks are currently private but we have plans to release them.

If you want to use background workers, you'll need to set up [Redis](http://redis.io/).

## Working with RubyMine

If using a remote setup (i.e. vagrant) make sure you set up a
[remote Ruby SDK using the RVM instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/2016.1/configuring-remote-ruby-interpreters.html?origin=old_help).

If you need sudo to install a gem (i.e. if Rubymine can't do it) try running `rvm fix-permissions`.
