%h1 Bioacoustic Workbench

%p The Acoustic Workbench is a repository for information and audio about fauna that make human-audible sounds.
%p We gather recordings from a wide range of environments, find practical ways to annotate the sounds with information about what's going on in them, and then enable that information to be put to use by ecologists and other parties interested in conservation.
