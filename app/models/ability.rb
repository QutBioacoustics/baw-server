    # and "can the current user read *this* project?" when checking an instance.
    # This is mainly relevant for :index, :create, and :new.
    # since they do no have an instance of the model.

    # WARNING: :manage represents ANY action on the object.

    # WARNING: instance variable in controller index action will not be set if using a block for can definitions
    # because there is no way to determine which records to fetch from the database.
