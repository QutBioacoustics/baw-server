# Steps

Steps are reusable functions used in gherkin/turnip/cucumber features.
We use turnip, but the principle is the same.

Steps in this folder are "global".

Steps can also be placed next to features.

These conventions are:
  - defined by us / our app (turnip purposely does not impose conventions)
  - configured in rails_helper.rb
